## 👋 Welcome!

I am **Byeong Cheol Lee**, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at **Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)**, advised by **Prof. Jae-Pil Heo**. My research lies at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction**, particularly focusing on how models can recognize and segment previously unseen concepts without task-specific training. 

<!-- My recent work explores **training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation** by aligning **global contextual cues** and **local window-based attention**.  -->

<!-- I have submitted a first-author paper titled  
**“Training-free Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction using Global-Local Alignment”** to a top-tier vision conference, where I demonstrate how expanding CLIP’s receptive field enables more accurate segmentation without additional supervision. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} -->

## 🔍 Research Interests

- **Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS)**
- **Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction**
- **Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation**
- **3D Reconstruction & Gaussian Splatting**

I aim to design **generalizable vision systems** that move beyond dataset-specific heuristics and adapt effectively to new environments.

## 🚀 Current Projects

I am actively involved in a **long-term national research initiative** titled:

**“Research on improving intelligent command and control capabilities based on generative AI and real-time 3D digital twin construction.”**

My contributions include:

- High-resolution **remote-sensing segmentation pipelines**
- **3D map construction** from drone imagery using **COLMAP and 3D Gaussian Splatting**
- Open-vocabulary model adaptation for dense prediction tasks 

<!-- 
I am also a co-author of **“Progressive Distractor Filtering for Robust 3D Representation”**, submitted to a top-tier conference. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} -->

## 🧪 Past Experience

I previously contributed to the national police project  
**“Detection of AI-based Fake Investigation and Tip Videos,”** where our team received the  
**Outstanding Achievement in Social Problem-Solving R&D Award**.  
My role involved developing generative models and managing deepfake datasets.
